            At Coffee Break, our team is more than just baristas and
            bakers—we’re a group of passionate individuals who believe in the
            power of good coffee and even better community. Each member brings
            their own unique skills, stories, and personality to the café,
            helping shape the space into what it is today: a welcoming spot
            where people gather, create, and connect. Whether we’re crafting the
            perfect pour-over, curating local art nights, or greeting you by
            name at the counter, we’re here to make every break feel just a
            little more meaningful.
